0.00 2.04 Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
2.32 3.22 by Lewis Carroll
3.70 4.71 CHAPTER I.
5.00 6.19 Down the Rabbit-Hole
7.05 10.46 Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank,
10.74 12.13 and of having nothing to do:
12.52 15.20 once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading,
15.38 17.71 but it had no pictures or conversations in it,
18.00 19.68 “and what is the use of a book,”
19.92 23.17 thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”
23.30 27.71 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
27.83 32.03 for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid),
32.68 35.18 whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain
35.33 39.21 would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
39.66 44.12 when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
44.42 47.38 There was nothing so very remarkable in that;
47.70 50.61 nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way
50.62 52.79 to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
53.07 54.08 “Oh dear!
54.08 54.64 Oh dear!
54.64 55.80 I shall be late!”
55.80 57.72 (when she thought it over afterwards,
57.72 61.32 it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
61.32 64.51 but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
65.36 70.16 but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket,
70.16 71.24 and looked at it,
71.24 73.32 and then hurried on,
73.32 75.16 Alice started to her feet,
75.16 78.41 for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen
78.41 80.76 a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket,
80.76 83.12 or a watch to take out of it,
83.12 84.96 and burning with curiosity,
84.96 87.20 she ran across the field after it,
87.20 90.36 and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down
90.36 93.04 a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
93.04 95.96 In another moment down went Alice after it,
95.96 100.16 never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
100.16 103.12 The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,
103.12 104.92 and then dipped suddenly down,
104.92 109.84 so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself
109.84 113.80 before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
113.80 116.04 Either the well was very deep,
116.04 117.52 or she fell very slowly,
117.52 121.12 for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her
121.12 123.32 and to wonder what was going to happen next.
123.32 124.20 First,
124.20 127.08 she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to,
127.08 129.84 but it was too dark to see anything;
129.84 131.76 then she looked at the sides of the well,
131.76 135.80 and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;
135.80 140.08 here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
140.08 142.76 She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed;
142.76 145.36 it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”,
145.36 148.72 but to her great disappointment it was empty:
148.72 152.40 she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath,
152.40 156.12 so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
156.12 157.24 “Well!”
157.24 158.84 thought Alice to herself,
158.84 160.88 “after such a fall as this,
160.88 163.64 I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!
163.64 166.00 How brave they’ll all think me at home!
166.00 166.48 Why,
166.48 168.20 I wouldn’t say anything about it,
168.20 170.60 even if I fell off the top of the house!”
170.60 173.20 (Which was very likely true.)
173.20 174.12 Down,
174.12 175.60 down,
175.60 178.32 down.
178.32 181.16 Would the fall never come to an end?
181.16 184.60 “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?”
184.60 185.52 she said aloud.
185.52 189.00 “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.
189.00 190.00 Let me see:
190.00 192.48 that would be four thousand miles down,
192.48 193.40 I think—”
193.40 194.04 (for,
194.04 194.80 you see,
194.80 198.28 Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom,
198.28 202.80 and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge,
202.80 204.64 as there was no one to listen to her,
204.64 207.76 still it was good practice to say it over)
207.76 209.12 “—yes,
209.12 210.68 that’s about the right distance —
210.68 213.96 but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?”
213.96 217.40 (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,
217.40 218.56 or Longitude either,
218.56 221.48 but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
221.48 223.56 Presently she began again.
223.56 226.32 “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth!
226.32 229.08 How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people
229.08 230.80 that walk with their heads downward!
230.80 233.12 The Antipathies,
233.12 233.80 I think—”
233.80 236.52 (she was rather glad there was no one listening,
236.52 237.40 this time,
237.40 240.04 as it didn’t sound at all the right word)

### timing

0.00 3.24 “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is,
3.24 3.60 you know.
3.60 4.68 Please,
4.68 5.20 Ma’am,
5.20 7.24 is this New Zealand or Australia?”
7.24 10.04 (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke —
10.04 13.32 fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air!
13.32 14.84 Do you think you could manage it?)
14.84 18.52 “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking!
18.52 19.48 No,
19.48 21.36 it’ll never do to ask:
21.36 23.84 perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”
23.84 25.04 Down,
25.04 26.24 down,
26.24 28.12 down.
28.12 29.52 There was nothing else to do,
29.52 31.76 so Alice soon began talking again.
31.76 34.44 “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night,
34.44 35.20 I should think!”
35.20 36.56 (Dinah was the cat.)
36.76 40.00 “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.
40.40 41.64 Dinah my dear!
41.64 43.80 I wish you were down here with me!
43.80 45.12 There are no mice in the air,
45.12 46.12 I’m afraid,
46.12 47.40 but you might catch a bat,
47.40 48.60 and that’s very like a mouse,
48.60 49.36 you know.
49.36 50.56 But do cats eat bats,
50.56 51.60 I wonder?”
51.60 54.44 And here Alice began to get rather sleepy,
54.44 56.08 and went on saying to herself,
56.08 57.60 in a dreamy sort of way,
57.60 61.04 “Do cats eat bats?
61.04 64.14 Do cats eat bats?”
64.34 65.44 and sometimes,
65.44 68.72 “Do bats eat cats?”
68.72 69.16 for,
69.16 70.28 you see,
70.28 72.68 as she couldn’t answer either question,
72.68 75.68 it didn’t much matter which way she put it.
75.68 77.88 She felt that she was dozing off,
77.88 81.96 and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah,
81.96 83.84 and saying to her very earnestly,
83.84 84.84 “Now,
84.84 85.24 Dinah,
85.24 86.64 tell me the truth:
86.64 88.56 did you ever eat a bat?”
88.56 89.32 when suddenly,
89.32 89.96 thump!
89.96 90.32 thump!
90.32 93.88 down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves,
93.88 95.96 and the fall was over.
95.96 97.64 Alice was not a bit hurt,
97.64 100.40 and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
100.40 101.52 she looked up,
101.52 103.52 but it was all dark overhead;
103.52 105.64 before her was another long passage,
105.64 107.64 and the White Rabbit was still in sight,
107.64 109.20 hurrying down it.
109.20 110.88 There was not a moment to be lost:
110.88 113.24 away went Alice like the wind,
113.24 115.12 and was just in time to hear it say,
115.12 116.28 as it turned a corner,
116.28 119.00 “Oh my ears and whiskers,
119.00 120.56 how late it’s getting!”
120.56 123.16 She was close behind it when she turned the corner,
123.16 125.12 but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:
125.12 127.08 she found herself in a long,
127.08 128.00 low hall,
128.00 131.20 which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
131.20 133.88 There were doors all round the hall,
133.88 135.44 but they were all locked;
135.44 138.88 and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other,
138.88 140.44 trying every door,
140.44 142.28 she walked sadly down the middle,
142.28 145.00 wondering how she was ever to get out again.
145.00 147.80 Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table,
147.80 149.60 all made of solid glass;
149.60 152.92 there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
152.92 155.12 and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong
155.12 156.48 to one of the doors of the hall;
156.48 157.24 but,
157.24 158.44 alas!
158.44 159.96 either the locks were too large,
159.96 161.48 or the key was too small,
161.48 165.32 but at any rate it would not open any of them.
165.32 165.84 However,
165.84 167.08 on the second time round,
167.08 170.00 she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before,
170.00 173.72 and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high:
173.72 176.40 she tried the little golden key in the lock,
176.40 179.04 and to her great delight it fitted!
179.04 183.08 Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage,
183.08 185.36 not much larger than a rat-hole:
185.36 187.56 she knelt down and looked along the passage
187.56 189.96 into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
189.96 193.28 How she longed to get out of that dark hall,
193.28 198.32 and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains,
198.32 201.32 but she could not even get her head through the doorway;
201.32 203.76 “and even if my head would go through,”
203.76 205.16 thought poor Alice,
205.16 208.92 “it would be of very little use without my shoulders.
208.92 209.44 Oh,
209.44 212.20 how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!
212.20 213.32 I think I could,
213.32 214.96 if I only knew how to begin.”
214.96 215.48 For,
215.48 215.96 you see,
215.96 219.20 so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
219.20 220.64 that Alice had begun to think
220.64 223.80 that very few things indeed were really impossible.
223.80 227.28 There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door,
227.28 228.92 so she went back to the table,
228.92 231.84 half hoping she might find another key on it,
231.84 235.64 or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes:
235.64 239.12 this time she found a little bottle on it,

3.20 5.75 to find out more visit our website
6.30 11.75 6 minute English from BBC learning English
12.55 15.00 <v Neil> Hello. This is 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.
15.20 16.30 <v Georgina> And I'm Georgina.
16.40 20.65 <v Neil> In this programm we’re focussing on the topic of mental health at work.
20.90 23.80 <v Georgina> Yes, it’s an issue that can be difficult to see.
24.15 28.30 If someone has an injury, like a broken leg or a serious medical issue,
28.55 31.25 it’s obvious, and we can understand what’s happening.
31.55 33.25 With mental health issues, though,
33.55 37.45 there’s no physical sign and people who are experiencing difficulties
37.65 41.75 maybe don’t get the same understanding as people who have medical problems.
41.90 45.10 <v Neil> It’s a topic that has been getting more publicity recently,
45.20 49.10 particularly as members of the British royal family have been talking about it.
49.50 54.00 Also, awareness is raised through events such as World Mental Health Day.
54.05 56.05 And that is the topic of our quiz.
56.15 59.95 World Mental Health Day is held every year on October 10th.
60.15 62.85 It aims to raise awareness of mental health issues
63.05 64.20 and their effects
64.25 65.45 on people’s lives.
65.70 67.40 In what year was it first held?
67.45 69.45 Was it... A: 1992
69.50 71.30 B: 2002
71.45 73.05 C: 2012
73.10 74.00 What do you think, Georgina?
74.10 76.70 <v Georgina> I don’t know – I think it will be
76.85 78.45 older than 2012, but as old as 1992?
79.00 81.10 I don’t know.
81.15 83.15 I’m going to go
83.45 85.00 with 2002
85.00 87.61 <v Neil> OK. I’ll have the answer later in the programme
87.86 89.36 and we’ll see if you’re right.
89.61 93.86 Mental health problems are very difficult personally for those who suffer from them,
94.11 96.71 and they also have an impact on businesses.
97.06 101.46 Paul Farmer is head of the mental health awareness charity Mind.
101.66 105.71 He spoke on the BBC World Service Business Daily programme about this.
106.06 109.26 How much does he says it costs businesses in the UK?
110.46 115.56 <v Paul Farmer, CEO Mind>We know that the cost of failing to address mental health in business is colossal.
115.61 120.26 In the UK, it costs between 33 and 42 billion pounds a year,
120.31 121.81 about $50 billion dollars,
121.86 126.76 and round about 300,000 people fall out of work every year
126.81 128.71 as a result of poor mental health.
128.76 132.81 So that’s a huge cost to workplaces and to individuals.
132.96 135.86 Behind those numbers, though, are the lives of
136.26 137.91 talented, able,
138.01 139.11 contributors
139.11 141.66 who often just slide away from the workplace
141.76 145.01 because they don’t get the right help and support for their mental health.
146.51 148.46 <v Neil> What figures did Paul Farmer give there?
149.06 151.11 <v Georgina> He gave the figure of about between
151.16 154.11 33 and £42 billion pounds
154.46 156.51 – which is about $50 billion dollars.
156.51 157.86 <v Neil> That’s a lot of money!
158.11 160.71 <v Georgina> It is – in fact he called it colossal.
161.31 164.56 This adjective means huge – really, really big.
165.06 166.96 This is the cost to business he says of
167.01 169.31 failing to address the mental health issue.
169.51 173.06 <v Neil> Failing to address means ignoring or not dealing with the problems.
173.31 175.06 It leads to staff leaving work,
175.11 177.56 and he says these people are contributors,
177.61 181.41 they give something to the business in terms of their skill and experience.
181.71 183.66 <v Georgina> And because of mental health issues,
183.71 185.71 which could be addressed but aren’t,
185.86 188.66 those contributors are being lost to the business.
188.91 192.86 So it costs companies more money to recruit and train new staff,
193.16 195.96 and you can’t always replace the experience that is lost.
196.01 197.36 <v Neil> Let’s listen again.
198.46 203.56 <v Paul Farmer, CEO Mind>We know that the cost of failing to address mental health in business is colossal.
203.61 208.26 In the UK, it costs between 33 and 42 billion pounds a year,
208.31 209.81 about $50 billion dollars,
209.86 214.76 and round about 300,000 people fall out of work every year
214.81 216.71 as a result of poor mental health.
216.76 220.81 So that’s a huge cost to workplaces and to individuals.
220.96 223.86 Behind those numbers, though, are the lives of
224.26 225.91 talented, able,
226.01 227.11 contributors
227.11 229.81 who often just slide away from the workplace
229.81 232.96 because they don’t get the right help and support for their mental health.
233.42 238.09 <v Neil> In recent years it seems as if there has been more understanding of mental health issues,
238.12 241.16 not just in the workplace but in society as a whole.
241.60 245.35 Geoff McDonald is a campaigner for the organisation Minds at Work.
245.76 250.53 He spoke on the Business Daily programme about one way that things were getting a little better.
251.57 253.19 <v Geoff McDonald, Minds at Work> I think what’s really changed
253.33 254.95 is people telling their stories,
255.01 257.07 and the more stories that we tell
257.09 258.94 it kind of begins to normalise this.
259.15 261.00 Every single story that we tell
261.13 263.58 is like sending a lifeboat out into the ocean
263.80 265.90 and the millions and millions of people
265.94 267.49 who are suffering in silence,
267.52 268.36 do you know what they do?
268.71 270.30 They cling on to that lifeboat
270.43 271.80 and they realise
271.83 272.98 they’re not alone
273.08 274.82 and they might just be normal.
276.04 278.85 <v Neil> So, because more people are talking about this issue,
278.89 280.67 it begins to normalise it.
280.98 282.88 This means it becomes ‘normal’.
282.93 285.42 It’s not unusual, strange or hidden.
285.70 287.74 <v Georgina> There are people who suffer in silence –
287.83 290.76 they keep to themselves and hide their problems from others,
291.09 293.76 but because there is more publicity about this topic,
293.96 298.48 they can begin to feel that they are not alone and they don’t have to suffer in silence.
298.55 303.25 <v Neil> People sharing their stories are like lifeboats for those who do suffer in silence.
303.70 306.60 In this metaphor they can cling onto the lifeboats.
306.72 309.86 Right, we’re going to another look at today’s vocabulary,
309.89 310.68 but first
